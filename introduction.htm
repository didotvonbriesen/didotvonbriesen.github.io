            <strong>Personal Background:</strong>Grew up in NM, then school in DC, grad school in VA, moved to Charlotte for work around '97. CPCC since '01. Seven kids, 4 cats, a fish, and a Gekkoâ€¦
        </li>
        <li> 
    Professional Background: apart from babysitting and that sort of thing as a kid I started as a teen with construction and working a movie theater. Then on to a wide variety of jobs, ranging from AV setup to cafeteria management and computer sales. Been teaching professionally since about 2000, not including stints as a skiing instructor.
</li>
<li> 
    Academic background: BSLA, MS/MIS, lots of training - i mean lots. Worked in everything from Ski Instruction to Movie theaters, but more recently as a consultant and teacher. I do a lot of conference presentations and professional workshops, and teach in a couple of different places along with my full-time work at CPCC. Information/Technology background: Started with macs in early 90's, then on to PC's in grad school, and now just see 'em all as tools. I want them to do the job, and don't care about much else. I see computers as magnifications of possibilities.
</li>
<li> 
    Background in this subject: I've been using computers since I was in college, and eventually ended up working on a computer store (including selling the software we teach in this class!) and getting a Masters in Management Information Systems. That doubled my salary in one year!
</li>
<li> 
    Primary Computer Platform: Windows 7-10 at home and work, though I just got a mac laptop to play with.

<li>    Funny/Interesting item about yourself: I donated my body to science in school to earn money - in one experiment i got $500 for letting them inject me with radioactive water for a PET scan. I'll always wonder...

            I'd also like to share: I'm hoping to make a vlogging channel that covers my adventures as a middle-aged dad.
